# Poll App

This app is based on the tutorial: [Writing your first Django app](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/intro/tutorial01/)


This app consists of two parts:

- A public site that lets people view polls and vote in them.
- An admin site that lets you add, change, and delete polls.

# Testing

- 10 tests were created using Python's built-in test framework.

# Initial thoughts on Django
  Pros:
  - Super intuitive, easy to get going quickly
  - Love the built in admin views - super quick to setup
  - Model driven migrations seems simpler than Rails
  - Like that reverse()  :)
  - Built-in test framework = awesome

  Cons:
  - From what I can see so far, Rails uses more "magic" while Django seems to be built for easier customization.  Less work to do in Rails, for example new regex must be created every time a new route is set up -- but this also offers more power.
  - I haven't gotten too deep, but wondering if Django's ORM is as full-featured as Rails' ActiveRecord.
  - I had heard there is less documentation on Django but I didn't have any problems getting going.  In fact, I found it much easier than when I first learned Rails.  The docs seem well-written to me and I easily found an answer to a couple questions on StackOverflow
