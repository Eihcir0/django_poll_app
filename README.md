# django_poll_app

This app is based on the tutorial: [Writing your first Django app](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/intro/tutorial01/)


This app consists of two parts:

- A public site that lets people view polls and vote in them.
- An admin site that lets you add, change, and delete polls.
